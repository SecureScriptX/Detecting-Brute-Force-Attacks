# How to Mitigate Brute Force Attacks

To safeguard your organization against brute force attacks, enforce the use of robust passwords. Consider the following best practices:

- **Avoid Information Found Online:** Steer clear of easily accessible information, such as names of family members.
- **Optimal Character Length:** Use as many characters as possible.
- **Diverse Character Types:** Combine letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Minimum 8 Characters:** Enforce a minimum password length of 8 characters.
- **Unique User Account Passwords:** Ensure each user account has a distinct password.
- **Avoid Common Patterns:** Discourage the use of common password patterns.

As administrators, here are some measures to protect users from brute-force attacks:

1. **Lock Policy:** Automatically lock accounts after a specified number of failed login attempts and unlock them through administrative intervention.

2. **Progressive Delays:** Temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.

3. **Recaptcha:** Integrate tools like Captcha-reCAPTCHA to mandate users to complete simple tasks before logging into the system.

4. **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce policies requiring users to define lengthy and complex passwords, and mandate periodic password changes.

5. **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):** Implement a second layer of verification (SMS, email, token, push notification, etc.) after entering the username and password.

## Brute Force Attack Detection (4.1)

Detecting brute force attacks often involves defining specific rules in SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems. These rules consider the number of unsuccessful login attempts within a defined timeframe. Analysis of relevant alarms involves examining trial protocol/application logs to draw necessary conclusions.
